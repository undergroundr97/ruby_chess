Assignment: 

Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.

This is from my perspective and the early days of learning OOP, a chess game.

When starting a new game, the white player(top), will be asked a prompt on what piece it wants to move. The inputs are in format of a letter and a number between a-h and 0-7 respectively.
When a move is done, it will change the current player and the same will be asked to pick a move.
Issues of going out of the board or picking the opposite piece are handled so you will be given a string with an error if you try to do so.
